FOLDER STRUCTURE

Input folder where I put highlights I have downloaded from the Kindle app.
	-This is where I should save the files when I am saving from the Kindle app.
	-Don't change the name of the highlights you download out of the Kindle app.
	-Files in here are deleted after KindleMemo runs.
	-When saving files from the Kindle app in here, remember they should overwrite the same book if it 		happens to still be in here.

Highlight Books
	-Folder where the the entire collection of highlights extracted are stored. Each book has it's own HTML 		file.

New Highlights
	-Highlights that aren't found in the extracted highlight get added here. This way I can just grab these 		files to import into SuperMemo instead of getting confused about which highlights I have 		already added or not.
